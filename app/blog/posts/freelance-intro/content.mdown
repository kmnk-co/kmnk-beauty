Hey there, sweet kitten. 🐾 This one’s from the heart.

I’ve been pouring my whole self — paws, fur, soul and sass — into building something beautiful: my own electrolysis business. Every zap I give is packed with purpose, every blog post laced with love. But what you might not know is that behind the scenes, I’m also a full-on **tech girlie** with a degree in software engineering — and I've used those skills to create everything from my website to my scheduling system, all by myself. 💅💻

And now I’m ready to do more.

## 💼 What I’ve Built So Far

Starting a small business is no joke — especially when you’re trans, femme, and doing it all with your own little paws. But I did it! I:

- Designed and launched a clean, responsive, mobile-friendly website
- Wrote every blog post (yes, including this one!) in my own voice
- Setup my own online scheduling portal
- Created my own client intake forms from scratch
- Wove love, safety, and affirming vibes into every pixel

It’s more than just my passion — it’s a **safe space online**, just like my studio is in person. ✨

## 🧠 What I Can Do for *You*

So here’s the truth: I’d love to **freelance** or **collaborate** with other queer creators, trans girls, small biz babes, and anyone in our rainbow community who needs a little tech magic. Here’s what I can offer:

- 🌐 Custom websites (from scratch or glow-ups)
- 🧩 Tech consulting and platform recommendations
- 🛠️ Help choosing scheduling tools, client forms, and automations
- 🧵 Content strategy and blog writing with heart
- 💖 A judgment-free, trans-aware collaborator who *gets it*

Whether you’re building a dream or just need a hand making things work, I’m here.

## 💌 Why This Matters to Me

I believe that every trans girl, every nonbinary sweetheart, every queer biz owner deserves to be **visible**, **legit**, and **unapologetically themselves** — online and off. Sometimes the tech part feels like a wall. Let me help you tear it down.

Because I’ve done it. I’m doing it. And I want you to thrive too. 💖

Whether you’re just starting out or looking to level up, I’d love to chat, dream, collaborate, or gently guide you through all the tech stuff that can feel so intimidating. Websites, systems, strategy — I’ve got you.
