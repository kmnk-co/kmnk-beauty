## 🔬 1875: The Birth of Electrolysis

Electrolysis didn’t come from the beauty world — it started in medicine! In 1875, **Dr. Charles Michel**, an ophthalmologist, developed it to remove **ingrown eyelashes** from his patients.

- He used a fine needle and **galvanic current** to destroy the hair root
- It was precise, effective, and **permanent**
- Word spread quickly, and soon electrolysis moved beyond the eyes and onto faces, underarms, and beyond!

Even in its earliest form, electrolysis was a blend of science, precision, and real results. 🩺⚡

## 💡 20th Century: Electrolysis Evolves

As technology advanced, so did electrolysis. Let’s zap through some major upgrades:

### ⚡ Thermolysis (Shortwave Diathermy)
- A faster alternative using heat alone
- Perfect for larger areas or clients needing speed
- More comfortable for some, but slightly less thorough on coarse hairs

### 🧪 The Blend Method (1940s–50s)
- Combined **galvanic current** with **high-frequency energy**
- Offered a balance of chemical and heat-based destruction
- Became the go-to for **stubborn hairs** and sensitive zones

These refinements helped electrolysis become a reliable method for people of all skin tones and hair colors, a distinction it still holds today. 💪✨

## 🔥 1990s: The Rise of Laser Hair Removal

Laser hair removal entered the scene in the 1990s, offering a new option for long-term hair reduction:

- Targets **melanin** (pigment), so it’s most effective on **dark hair and light skin**
- Can treat large areas quickly by zapping multiple hairs at once
- Results in **reduction** rather than full removal, with some regrowth possible over time

Laser has become especially popular for larger body areas like legs and backs. It’s effective for many — though not ideal for everyone.
