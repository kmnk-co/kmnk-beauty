You might think a hair is just… there. But oh no — that little strand is living its best life in one of **three magical stages**! And if you’re zapping your fuzz away with electrolysis (or laser!), understanding these stages is key to making every session count. 🐾

## 🌱 The Three Stages of Hair Growth

Each hair goes through a full cycle of growing, transitioning, and resting. Here’s the tea on those stages:

| **Stage**     | **Name** | **What’s Happening**                                | **Electrolysis Effectiveness** |
| ------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| ✨ Growth      | Anagen   | Hair is actively growing from the follicle          | ✅ *Most effective!*            |
| 💤 Resting    | Telogen  | Hair is chilling — not growing, just hanging out    | ⚠️ Less effective              |
| 🔄 Transition | Catagen  | Follicle detaches from the blood supply and shrinks | 🚫 Not ideal                   |

## ✨ Anagen Phase — The Star of the Show

This is when the hair is *alive* and thriving, attached to its follicle, and growing strong.

- ✅ Best time for electrolysis (and laser!)
- ⚡ The energy can destroy the growth center directly
- ⏳ This phase can last *years* for scalp hair, but only *weeks* for body hair

Only a portion of your hair is in this phase at any time, which is why multiple sessions are needed. It’s like catching those pesky strands when they least expect it — mid-sprint! 🏃‍♀️💨

## 🔄 Catagen Phase — The Transition

Think of this like your hair’s “moving out” stage. The follicle says, “I’m done here,” and the hair detaches from its blood supply.

- 🧳 The follicle shrinks and preps for rest
- ⚠️ Electrolysis is less effective here — the target zone is already checking out

Zapping during this stage? It will still sting, but it may not fully work. Like scolding someone who already packed their bags! 😅

## 💤 Telogen Phase — Rest & Reset

This hair is straight up *loafing*. It’s not growing, just waiting to fall out.

- 💭 Follicle is inactive
- 💔 Zapping won’t do much here either
- 😴 Eventually, the hair will shed and the cycle begins again

This phase is like your follicle taking a nap with an “Out of Office” reply on. Come back later, sweetie! 😴

## 🐾 Why This Matters for Your Glow-Up

Electrolysis works best during the anagen phase — but not all hairs are there at the same time. That’s why:

- You’ll need **multiple sessions**, spaced out over weeks or months
- Your tech might spot new growth each time — that’s totally normal!
- Patience is key, pretty kitty! Your consistency = your results 💖
