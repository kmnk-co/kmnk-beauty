## ðŸ’¸ Pricing & Payment

Electrolysis is billed by time, so you only pay for the care you need:

- **15 minutes** â€“ $30  
- **30 minutes** â€“ $50  
- **45 minutes** â€“ $60  
- **60 minutes** â€“ $70  

All payments are due at the time of your appointment. I accept **Cash**, **Venmo**, **Apple Cash**, and **credit or debit cards.**

If you pay in **cash**, youâ€™ll receive a **$5 discount** as a thank-you for helping me avoid card processing fees. I also offer a **$5 discount for LGBTQ+ clients**â€”a small gesture of love and support for our community.

> *As I continue to grow and evolve in this work, **prices may change** over time. Iâ€™ll always communicate those changes as clearly and kindly as I can.   â€” Kamella*

âœ¨ Thank you for supporting a small, trans-owned business. Your care, trust, and presence mean the world to me. âœ¨

## ðŸ•° Appointment & Cancellation Policy

All appointments require confirmation. Your appointment is **not guaranteed** until you receive a confirmation email from the **Cal.com system**. This helps ensure I can maintain a consistent schedule and give each client the time and care they deserve.

- Appointments must be requested **at least 12 hours in advance.**
- Youâ€™re welcome to request appointments **up to 60 days in advance**, but I usually build my schedule **week by week**â€”typically on weekends. That means appointments may not be confirmed until closer to their actual date.
- If you like your current time and want to come weekly, let me know! Iâ€™ll do my best to keep that slot available for you. But since I schedule week-to-week, **recurring appointments are not guaranteed.**

> *If something changes on my end or there's a conflict, Iâ€™ll always do my best to reach out or help you reschedule as soon as possible.   â€” Kamella*

If you need to cancel or move your appointment, please give **at least 24 hoursâ€™ notice.** Appointments cancelled with less than 24 hoursâ€™ notice may be subject to a **$10 cancellation fee.**

## ðŸ›‹ Guest Policy

I totally understand that getting electrolysis can feel vulnerable, especially if it's your first time. If youâ€™re feeling nervous or need a little emotional support, youâ€™re welcome to bring **one trusted guest** with you.

That said, I work out of my **home**â€”not a commercial studioâ€”so Iâ€™m **not generally set up to host extra people**.

- Please let me know **in advance** if you plan to bring someone.
- I can only accommodate **one guest per appointment.**
- I donâ€™t have separate seating available, so your guest will need to **sit on the floor** during the session.

Thanks so much for understanding and helping me keep my space safe, respectful, and cozy for everyone ðŸ’›

## ðŸš» Restroom Use Policy

Since I work out of my home, the restroom available is part of my **private living space**, and I prefer not to use it for client appointments unless itâ€™s an **emergency**.

If possible, please plan to **use the restroom before arriving** for your session. There is a public restroom nearby, but itâ€™s in another building and **not accessible without a key fob**, so itâ€™s unfortunately not a reliable option.

## ðŸ”’ Privacy Policy

Your trust means everything to me, and I take your privacy seriously.

When you fill out a client card during your initial consultation, I collect a small amount of personal informationâ€”such as your **name**, **email**, and **phone number**. This information is used for a few essential purposes:

- **Scheduling:** Your info is used to book appointments through **Cal.com**, which may send confirmation and reminder messages.
- **Building Access:** I use **ButterflyMX** to create temporary door keys using your email or phone number.
- **Payment Processing:** If you pay with a credit or debit card, your name is processed securely through **GoPayment** (by **Intuit QuickBooks**).

I do **not sell, rent, or share** your personal information with any third parties. I may occasionally contact you if thereâ€™s an issue with your appointment, but I will never use your information to promote products or services unless youâ€™ve explicitly opted in.

**Fun Fact:** Thereâ€™s a question on the client card asking if you'd like to receive promotional emails. I donâ€™t currently send any, but I like to ask just in caseâ€”so I wonâ€™t have to bug you later if that ever changes.

> *Thank you for trusting me with your care. If you ever have questions about your information or how itâ€™s used, Iâ€™m always happy to talk. â€” Kamella*
